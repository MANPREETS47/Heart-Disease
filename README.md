# ﻿❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning–based application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on medical parameters. The model is trained using multiple classification algorithms, and after comparative evaluation, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was selected as the final model due to its superior performance.

A Streamlit-based frontend is used to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives

To analyze medical data and predict heart disease risk

To compare multiple classification algorithms and select the best-performing model

To deploy the final model using a simple and interactive web interface

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
🔹 Data Preprocessing

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Feature scaling performed using StandardScaler

Train-test split applied for evaluation

🔹 Model Selection

Multiple classification algorithms were trained and evaluated, including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

After comparing accuracy scores and overall performance, KNN achieved the best accuracy, making it the final selected model.
